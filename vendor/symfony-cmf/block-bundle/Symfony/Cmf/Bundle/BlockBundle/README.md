This bundle is part of the [Symfony Content Management Framework (CMF)](http://cmf.symfony.com/)
and licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

The BlockBundle provides integration with
[SonataBlockBundle](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataBlockBundle).
It is used to manage fragments of content, so-called blocks, that are persisted
in a database and can be incorporated into any page layout. The BlockBundle also
provides a few commonly used standard blocks, including the ability to edit them.
