# Jackalope [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal)

Implementation of the persisting data into relational databases.

Provide the [PHPCR API](http://phpcr.github.io) implementation
[Jackalope](http://github.com/jackalope/jackalope) with storing data into
relational databases with Doctrine DBAL. Tested to work with MySQL, PostgreSQL
and SQLite.

For the moment, it is less feature complete and robust than [Jackalope-Jackrabbit](http://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit).

# Preconditions

* php >= 5.3
* One of the following databases, including the PDO extension for it:
    * MySQL >= 5.1.5 (we need the ExtractValue function)
    * PostgreSQL
    * SQLite


# Installation

The recommended way to install jackalope is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
You can of course do without, but then you will need to resolve the dependencies
manually.

    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    ./composer.phar init
    ./composer.phar require jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal
    ./composer.phar install


## Create a repository

Set up a new database supported by Doctrine DBAL. You can use your favorite GUI frontend or just do something like this:

### MySQL

Note that you need at least version 5.1.5 of MySQL, otherwise you will get ``QLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1305 FUNCTION cmf-app.EXTRACTVALUE does not exist``

    mysqladmin -u root -p  create jackalope
    echo "grant all privileges on jackalope.* to 'jackalope'@'localhost' identified by '1234test'; flush privileges;" | mysql -u root -p

### PostgreSQL
    psql -c "CREATE ROLE jackalope WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '1234test' NOINHERIT LOGIN;" -U postgres
    psql -c "CREATE DATABASE jackalope WITH OWNER = jackalope;" -U postgres

### SQLite
    Database is created automagically if you specify driver and path ("pdo_sqlite", "jackalope.db"). Databasename is not needed.

For further details, please see the [Doctrine configuration page](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#connection-details).


## Enable the commands

There are a couple of useful commands to interact with the repository.

To use the console, copy ``cli-config.php.dist`` to ``cli-config.php`` and configure
the connection parameters.
Then you can run the commands from the jackalope directory with ``./bin/jackalope``

NOTE: If you are using PHPCR inside of **Symfony**, the DoctrinePHPCRBundle
provides the commands inside the normal Symfony console and you don't need to
prepare anything special.

Jackalope specific commands:

* ``jackalope:init:dbal``: Initialize the configured database for jackalope with the
    Doctrine DBAL transport.

Commands available from the phpcr-utils:

* ``phpcr:workspace:create <name>``: Create a workspace *name* in the repository
* ``phpcr:register-node-types --allow-update [cnd-file]``: Register namespaces
    and node types from a "Compact Node Type Definition" .cnd file
* ``phpcr:dump [--sys_nodes[="..."]] [--props[="..."]] [path]``: Show the node
    names under the specified path. If you set sys_nodes=yes you will also see
    system nodes. If you set props=yes you will additionally see all properties
    of the dumped nodes.
* ``phpcr:purge``: Remove all content from the configured repository in the
     configured workspace
* ``phpcr:sql2``: Run a query in the JCR SQL2 language against the repository
    and dump the resulting rows to the console.



# Bootstrapping

Jackalope relies on autoloading. Namespaces and folders are compliant with
PSR-0. You should use the autoload file generated by composer:
``vendor/autoload.php``

If you want to integrate jackalope into other PSR-0 compliant code and use your
own classloader, find the mapping in ``vendor/composer/autoload_namespaces.php``

Before you can use jackalope with a database, you need to set the database up.
Create a database as described above, then make sure the command line utility
is set up (see above "Enable the commands"). Now you can run:

    bin/jackalope jackalope:init:dbal

Once these steps are done, you can bootstrap the library. A minimalist
sample code to get a PHPCR session with the doctrine-dbal backend:

    // For further details, please see Doctrine configuration page.
    // http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#connection-details
    $driver    = 'pdo_mysql'; // pdo_pgsql | pdo_sqlite
    $host      = 'localhost';
    $user      = 'jackalope';
    $password  = '';
    $database  = 'jackalope'; // $path = 'jackalope.db'; // for SQLite
    $workspace = 'default';

    // Bootstrap Doctrine
    $dbConn = \Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'driver'    => $driver,
        'host'      => $host,
        'user'      => $user,
        'password'  => $pass,
        'dbname'    => $database,
        // 'path'   => $path, // for SQLite
    ));

    $factory = new \Jackalope\RepositoryFactoryDoctrineDBAL();
    $repository = $factory->getRepository(
        array('jackalope.doctrine_dbal_connection' => $dbConn)
    );
    // dummy credentials to comply with the API
    $credentials = new \PHPCR\SimpleCredentials(null, null);
    $session = $repository->login($credentials, $workspace);

To use a workspace different than ``default`` you need to create it first. The
easiest is to run the command ``bin/jackalope phpcr:workspace:create <myworkspace>``
but you can of course also use the PHPCR API to create workspaces from your code.


# Usage

The entry point is to create the repository factory. The factory specifies the
storage backend as well. From this point on, there are no differences in the
usage (except for supported features, that is).

    // see Bootstrapping for how to get the session.

    $rootNode = $session->getNode("/");
    $whitewashing = $rootNode->addNode("www-whitewashing-de");
    $session->save();

    $posts = $whitewashing->addNode("posts");
    $session->save();

    $post = $posts->addNode("welcome-to-blog");
    $post->addMixin("mix:title");
    $post->setProperty("jcr:title", "Welcome to my Blog!");
    $post->setProperty("jcr:description", "This is the first post on my blog! Do you like it?");

    $session->save();

for a more detailed tutorial on how to use the PHPCR API.


# Implementation notes

See [doc/architecture.md](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/blob/master/doc/architecture.md)
for an introduction how Jackalope is built. Have a look at the source files and
generate the phpdoc.

# Running the tests

Jackalope-doctrine-dbal is integrated with the phpcr-api-tests suite that tests
all PHPCR functionality.

If you want to run the tests, please see the [README file in the tests folder](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/blob/master/tests/README.md).


# Things left to do

The best overview of what needs to be done are the skipped API tests.
Have a look at [ImplementationLoader](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/blob/master/tests/ImplementationLoader.php)
to see what is currently not working and start hacking :-)

Also have a look at the issue trackers of this project and the base jackalope/jackalope.
